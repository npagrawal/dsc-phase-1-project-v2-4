## The Problem
### Hollywood is highly satured. How would a newcomer make movies that make money?

The brief: Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. 

Explore the data to determine what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. Translate these findings into actionable insights a company like Microsoft can use.


## The Data

Movie information, including titles, runtime in minutes, and genres were collected from __[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)__. 

Additionally, I used data from __[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)__ that included release dates for movies, production budget, domestic gross revenue, and worldwide gross revenue.


## Methodology

The major determinant for a successful movie is profit, both worldwide profit and domestic. Worldwide and domestic profit are determined by subtracting production budget from worldwide gross revenue and domestic gross revenue respectively. 

To begin, I cleaned my datasets to includeon relevant information to determine the relationship between specific variables (month of release, genre, runtime, and director) and profits. Further, I included descriptive analysis and visualizations to demonstrate these relationships. Finally, I provide conclusions to guide Microsoft Studios as it chooses which films to make and how to market them.
